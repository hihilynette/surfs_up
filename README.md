Below is the analysis

1. The overall temperatures in June falls with 75 to 80 degrees while in December, it is usually fall within 70 to 75. 
2. The minimum temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than in June.
2. There is around 5-10 temperature degree differences in Oahu, therefore W.Avy cannot expect Winter's weather to be as hot as in Summer.The needs of surfing and ice cream could be much smaller in December.

## Summary
Oahu has a very comfortable weather over the year. It is definetly a good place to surf and have the ice cream shop. While Winter is not as hot as in Summer, the temperature still maintains around 71 degrees. According to the statistics for the percipitation in both months, we can tell that it has similar situations for rainfalls. December is slightly heavier than in June. Combining both temperature and percipitation summaries, W.Avy should feel safe to invest in this project.
